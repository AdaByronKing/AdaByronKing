Hello

My name is Skyla and I am interested in Ada Programming. Having met the late Robert Dewer (R.I.P) I was fascinated by the language.
I have previous experience in Java and C, and know a little C++ and C#. It's very hard to see Ada becoming a mainstream language like
C and Python, but it has is community and is updated by the ISO standard.
